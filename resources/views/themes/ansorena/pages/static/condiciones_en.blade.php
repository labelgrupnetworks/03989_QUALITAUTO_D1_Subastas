    <p>The majority of the lots included in the auction require the express prior authorisation of the State
        Administration in order to leave Spanish territory. The client will be responsible for obtaining any
        such permits, and the fact that they are not granted or any delay in obtaining them shall not under any
        circumstances exempt the client from paying for the work.</p>
    <p>The majority of the works are subject to the payment of export taxes, which shall be paid by the buyer.
        Any works sent to EU countries shall be exempt from the taxes in question.</p>
    <p>The lots which have already been granted such authorisation, are exportable in accordance with Act 16/85
        and its enabling legislation, or are covered by temporary import regulations are marked with an asterisk
        next to the lot number.</p>
    <p>If authorisation is requested, the Auction Room hereby advises its clients that any such request shall
        for all purposes represent an irrevocable offer of sale in favour of the Spanish State.</p>
    <h2 class="ff-highlight">V.- PREVENTION OF MONEY LAUNDERING AND TERRORIST FINANCING ACT 10/210</h2>
    <p>Ansorena shall be bound to comply with the provisions of Act 10/2010 and, in particular, with regard to
        persons with public responsibility (in other words, those who hold or have held prominent public
        functions in Spanish state, regional or local government, senior management positions in trade union or

        of them). Acceptance by the buyer and/or seller of Ansorena's terms and conditions of contract
        represents an express declaration by the buyer and/or seller that he/she is not a person with public
        responsibility according to the provisions of the Act; if this is not the case, he/she shall be bound to
        provide Ansorena with verifiable notification in this regard.</p>

        where there is a legal obligation. You have the right to obtain confirmation as to whether Ansorena, S.A
        and Mato Ansorena, S.A are dealing with your personal data, therefore you have the right to access your
        personal data, correct the inaccurate data or request its deletion when the data is no longer necessary
        for the data purposes that were collected.</p>
    <p>Ansorena, S.A and Mato Ansorena, S.A informs you that it has adopted all technical and organizational

    <p>38. STORAGE AND FREIGHT CHARGES</p>
    <p>The customer, both seller and buyer, must withdraw the lots within the periods indicated in these Terms
        and Conditions of Contract, (sections 25 and 36). 6 per day (VAT not included); these costs shall be

    <p>Buyers must be responsible for the organization of the transport of the lots, in the event that they
        cannot pick them up personally, being the responsibility of the buyer the shipping costs of the same and
        their sole responsibility for the loss or damage that may occur during transport.</p>
    <p>In this sense, we indicate that Ansorena does not intervene, in any way, in the shipping process of your
        purchased lots and is not responsible, therefore, for any damages that may arise from it. Consequently,
        the lots are at your disposal at the headquarters of this Auction House, at Calle Alcal&aacute;, N&ordm;
        52 or at our warehouse, (by appointment) so that you can agree with the transport company of your choice
        the conditions of shipment of the lots.</p>
    <p>Likewise, we inform you that, if you so wish, you have the possibility to subscribe, with the transport
        company you have designated, an insurance contract whose purpose is to insure the contents of the
        shipment in the event of any loss occurring during the transport of the lots.</p>
    <p>Notwithstanding the above, ANSORENA collaborates with companies specializing in the transport of works of
        art from which customers may request the transport of the lots purchased once payment has been made in
        full, at their own risk, without ANSORENA intervening in this contractual relationship, and may contact
