			<article>
				<p>The new generation, Jesús Vico Belmonte, currently holds the presidency of AENP (2017) and vice-presidency of

				<p>Moreover, <strong>Jesús Vico has adapted himself to the new demands of the market by doing both online and
					in-person auctions and taking part in the main international numismatic fairs (New York, London,
					Munich…).</strong></p>
				<p>In addition, the company has partnered with numerous entities and businesses related to the sector in order to
					offer the best service to collectors, such as FNMT-RCM (‘National Coinage and Stamp Factory-Royal Mint’), the

					legality, authenticity and the fulfilment of a rigorous code of ethics are the basic principles on which Jesús
					Vico S.A. is based.</p>
